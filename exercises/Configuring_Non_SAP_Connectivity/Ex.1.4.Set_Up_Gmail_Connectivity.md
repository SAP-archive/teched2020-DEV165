# Set Up Gmail Connectivity

In this exercise, you will set up connectivity between your **Cloud Integration** tenant and your **Gmail** account. You will use the **Connectivity Tests** feature available in the **Cloud Integration** ***Monitoring*** view to connect to your email account. Once the connectivity test is successful, you will download the Gmail server certificates and then import it into your **Cloud Integration** tenant. This will ensure that the connectivity will be validated with the requisite server certificates when you call your **GMail** account with your integration flow.
