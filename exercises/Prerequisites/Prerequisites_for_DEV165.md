If you already have a **Slack** account, you can use that as well. Create a new workspace for this hands-on exercise by following these steps: [Create a New Slack Workspace](https://slack.com/intl/en-de/help/articles/206845317-Create-a-Slack-workspace).

## GMail Account - Create new or use an existng one
You can use your existing GMail accout or create a new one. For creating a new one, you can follow the steps mentioned here: [Create new GMail account](https://accounts.google.com/signup/v2/webcreateaccount?flowName=GlifWebSignIn&flowEntry=SignUp). 

### Additional Settings for Google Account
You need to configure your **GMail** account to enable it to receive emails from applications. Since you are using a private **GMail** account, some of these settings will be set to high-security level by default. When you are using enterprise **GMail** accounts, these settings may or may not be necessary depending on the organizations security policies. 

#### Disable Two-Factor Authentication
You have to disable two-factor authentication since this is required for **Cloud Integration** to deliver emails to your account. Follow the steps mentioned here: [Disable Two-Factor Authentication](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1064203?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en).

#### Enable Access for Less Secure Apps
You have to enable your GMail account to connect to less secure apps. Please follow the [steps mentioned here](https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps) to configure this option. This is Google terminology for allowing applicaton-based access to your GMail account. If you are not comfortable doing this to your personal account, you can create a new one for this hands-on exercise.
