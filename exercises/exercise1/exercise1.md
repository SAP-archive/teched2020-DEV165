# Setting Up Components for Building Your Integration Scenario

In this exercise, you will configure all the components that are required to build, deploy and test your non-SAP integration scenario. You will perform the following steps:

## Authenticate Open Connector Instances with Non-SAP Applications

To enable connectivty between **Integration Suite** and non-SAP applications, you create ***Instances*** in the **Open Connectors** capability. Here, you will find the connector for the non-SAP applications, ***Slack*** and ***BambooHR*** and authenticate them with the required credntials. You can then use these authenticated instances to build your integration scenario. 

### Create Slack Instance

### Create Bamboo HR Instance

## Deploy Credentials of Non-SAP Applications on Cloud Integration

Since there are three non-SAP systems that you will be using in this hands-on exercise, you will have to deploy the credentials (login details) of all these applications on your **Cloud Integration** tenant. 

## Configuring Connectivity to Your Gmail Account

You will be using the ***Mail*** adapter in the **Cloud Integration** capability to send an email to the **GMail** account of the new hire. To do this, you have to setup connectivity between **Cloud Integration** and **GMail** server
